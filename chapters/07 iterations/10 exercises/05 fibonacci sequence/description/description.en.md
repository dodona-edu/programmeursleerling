The Fibonacci sequence is named after Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, later known as Fibonacci. The sequence starts with 0 and 1. Each of the next numbers in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding ones. The beginning of the sequence is thus:

> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, â€¦
