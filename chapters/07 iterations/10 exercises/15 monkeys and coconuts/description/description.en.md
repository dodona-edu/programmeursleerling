According to an old puzzle, five pirates
and their monkey are stranded on an island. During the day they gather
coconuts, which they put in a big pile. When night falls, they go
asleep.

In the middle of the night, the first pirate wakes up, and, not trusting
his buddies, he divides the pile into five equal parts, takes what he
believes to be his share and hides it. Since he had one coconut left
after the division, he gives it to the monkey. Then he goes back to
sleep.

An hour later, the next pirate wakes up. He behaves in the same way as
the first pirate: he divides the pile into five equal shares, with one
coconut left over which he gives to the monkey, hides what he believes
to be his share, and goes to sleep again.

The same happens to the other pirates: they wake up one by one, divide
the pile, give one coconut to the monkey, hide their share, and go back
to sleep.

In the morning they all wake up. They divide what remains of the
coconuts equally amongst them. Since that leaves one coconut, they give
it to the monkey.

The question is: what is the smallest number of coconuts that they can
have started with?
