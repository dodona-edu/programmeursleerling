This book is meant to be used as a course. It is not meant as a Python
language reference. You do not need a book as a language reference, as
an excellent language reference can be found on the Internet
(<http://docs.python.org>{:target="_blank"}).

The chapters of this book are written to be studied in sequential order.
For a brief course on the basics of the Python language, using it for
"imperative programming," you should study variables and expressions,
conditions and loops, functions, string handling, lists and
dictionaries, and files. I.e., you can limit yourself to Chapters
2
to
20,
whereby the Chapters
10
(Recursion),
15
(Sets),
18
(Exceptions),
19
(Binary files), and
20
(Bitwise operators) may be considered advanced material, which you can
skip until you need them (though I highly recommend that you at least
try to understand recursion, as it helps solving some of the exercises
in later chapters).

For an advanced course on the basics of the Python language, you will
have to delve into object orientation, meaning that you also have to
study Chapters
21
to
24,
whereby Chapter
24
(Iterators and Generators) can be considered optional material.

The remainder of the chapters are all useful, but optional material,
from which you can pick and choose, though I recommend that you at least
read through them to understand the topics that they cover. Future
editions of this book may have extra optional material added to the end.

When studying this book, you should have a computer with Python
installed at hand (Chapter
3
explains how to get Python for your computer). The book contains many
small and larger exercises, and you should do all of those while
studying. There is no way that you will learn how to program if you skip
the exercises. More on the exercises follows later in this chapter
(Section
<a href="#sec:introduction.practice" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:introduction.practice">[sec:introduction.practice]</a>).

Many of the code snippets in this book – in particular all the answers
to the exercises and all the slightly longer pieces of code – have a
file name listed as a caption. This means that this code is available
under that particular file name from the website associated with this
book (<http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook>{:target="_blank"}). You can download this code
and load it immediately in the editor that you are using if you so wish.

> #### Note
> **Note that copying and pasting code from a PDF file to an editor will, in general, not work.** Text in a PDF file is not stored in such a way that spaces are inserted in the correct places when you copy code. So you must either manually type in code, or use the listings that are provided as separate files.
