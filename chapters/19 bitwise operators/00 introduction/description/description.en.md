discussed dealing with binary files. When binary files are used, you are
no longer working with characters and numbers; rather, you are working
with bytes. To manipulate information on the level of bytes, Python
offers a number of so-called "bitwise operators." You will not need
these often, but when you delve into binary file manipulation, they
might come in handy.
