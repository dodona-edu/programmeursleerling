    <p>Computational technology causes the world to change rapidly.</p>
    <p>Almost 30 years ago I got my first job as a computer programmer. At the
      time, only larger companies with a big administrative overload used
      computers. Or rather, "a computer", because it was rare for a company to
      have more than one. There were no personal computers, no Internet, no
      mobile phones. People still used typewriters.</p>
    <p>In those 30 years, the way people work and live has undergone huge
      changes. That is exceptionally clear when looking at the kind of work that
      people do. Mailmen, for instance, delivered the mail twice per
      day when I was a kid &#8212; now they deliver mail twice per week, which
      means that the contingent of professional mailmen has been decimated. Bank
      offices are closed because banking can be done much easier online.
      Information desks can be manned by digital avatars or be replaced by
      online information systems. Large department stores go out of business
      because people make their purchases online, leading to an enormous decline
      in the need for having salespeople. And though this has currently caused a
      small increase in the demand for people who work in transportation, we can
      see self-driving cars on the horizon, replacing the need to have any
      chauffeurs at all.</p>
    <p>These are all "low profile" jobs, but "high profile" jobs aren't safe
      either. I have taught programming to professional journalists, who told me
      that computers are taking over large parts of their jobs, writing basic
      articles and doing automated background research &#8212; they wanted to
      take my courses because they realized that without skills in digital
      technology, they would be out of a job in a few years time. Programs have
      been developed that take over a menial but oh-so time consuming part of
      lawyers' jobs, namely researching case histories. Computers can write
      music, produce paintings, and even sculpt &#8212; why would you have
      someone hammer away at a block of granite for six months when a 3D-printer
      can produce a sculpture with a few hours of work? Even designing and
      running scientific experiments has been offloaded to computers in some
      research domains.</p>
    <p>In the 30 years in which I have been a professional worker, I have seen
      the job market change from hardly incorporating computers at all, to a
      situation in which the need for human employees has been reduced
      considerably &#8212; regardless the job. And that change has not come to
      an end yet.</p>
    <p>This does not mean that there is no place for humans in the job market.
      It does mean, however, that only humans who can make contributions that a
      computer has a hard time making on its own, can be assured of a job. In
      the near future, employability will be invariably linked to the ability to
      integrate the power of humans and computers in a way that enhances both of
      them.</p>
    <p>The problem is that to be able to use computers to improve the quality of
      one's work, it does not suffice to be able to use a word processor or
      spreadsheet. One should actually be able to expand the capabilities of
      computers from the perspective of one's chosen profession. For example, a
      journalist who can only run a fact-finding computer program that someone
      else wrote, is not needed. However, a journalist who is able to expand a
      fact-finding program so that it can come up with facts from new sources,
      is an asset.</p>
    <p>To be able to employ computers in such a way, one needs the skills to
      think and solve problems like a computer programmer. Having taught
      students computer programming for many years, I know that this does not
      come naturally to most. To acquire the necessary skills, students need to
      spend several intensive courses on the topic.</p>
    <p>Considering the fact that universities and colleges are supposed to
      prepare students for the job market in which they have to function for 40
      or more years, and considering the fact that in the very near future (if
      not right now already) the ability to incorporate the power of computers
      in any job is a necessity to being a valued worker, one would expect that
      "computer programming" is one of the basic courses that any student needs
      to take. Unfortunately, it is not. Typically, basic required courses are
      "scientific writing", "philosophy of science", and "statistics", but
      "computer programming" is still seen, by most education programs, as an
      optional skill. It is not.</p>
    <p>In my view, any course program that does not make "computer programming"
      a required course, is doing its students a disservice, as it is not
      preparing them for the job market. Actually, I would prefer it if
      secondary, or even primary schools would incorporate such courses, as
      programming skills tend to be easier to learn at a younger age. The reason
      is that they need a particular way of creative thinking, which is harder
      to acquire when one is already used to solving problems in the
      reproductive ways that are normally taught at schools.</p>
    <p>All students, regardless of their chosen topic, need to learn how to
      program. Not because we should raise a generation of computer programmers
      &#8212; professional programming is a specialization that only a few
      people need to be able to do. But the ability to create programs provides
      students with the skills to think and solve problems like a computer
      programmer, to gain insight in the possibilities and limitations of
      computers, and to leverage the power of computers in a particular domain
      in a uniquely human way.</p>
    <p>The goal of this book is to teach anyone how to create useful programs in
      Python. It should be usable by secondary school students, and university
      and college students for whom computer programming is not naturally
      incorporated in their course program. Its aim is to give anyone the means
      to become proficient in programming, and as such get prepared to perform
      well in the 21st century job market.</p>
