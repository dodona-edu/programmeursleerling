    <p>Most chapters have small exercises sprinkled throughout the text. These
      exercises are there to enlighten a point or for you to do a quick check if
      you understood the material up to that moment. You should try to do these
      exercises immediately when you encounter them. Answers to these exercises
      are seldom provided, because if you understood the material, they should
      be really easy to do, while if you did not understand the material, you
      should either re-read the chapter until you do, or ask someone for
      assistance.</p>
    <p>At the end of most chapters, a separate "Exercises" section is given,
      with one or more numbered exercises. You are supposed to do all of these
      exercises, and you should be able to do them independently (i.e., without
      help of other people and without looking up solutions from outside
      sources). Answers to these numbered exercises are provided in the back of
      the book, in Appendix F, and can also be downloaded from the website
      associated with this book (<a href="http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook" target="_blank">http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook</a>).
      I wish to stress the following points:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You should work on the numbered exercises until you have solved them.
          Do not dabble a bit and then look up the answer. Such an approach is
          utterly useless. There is no way that you are going to learn
          programming if you do not think about algorithms, write code, and test
          code. If you cannot solve an exercise even after you have worked on it
          for quite some time, it is better to ask for assistance than to just
          look up the answer. Being unable to solve an exercise means that there
          is something in the material that you have not grasped yet, and it is
          important that you identify what that is, and get to grips with it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You should do all of the exercises. The only way to learn programming
          is by practicing. You will have to write lots and lots of code before
          you have internalized the practice of programming. The few exercises
          that I place at the end of the chapters are not enough to accomplish
          that, but at least they are a start. If you cannot even bother to do
          all of those, you should not bother to try to learn programming.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You should try to do the exercises independently. Working in teams on
          the exercises will allow one member of the team to learn, while the
          rest sits by and learns nothing. Students often say that they have a
          method of learning from assignments that involves working on them in
          small groups and discussing. That may be fine for analyzing texts or
          setting up an experiment, but in general does not work for coding.
          Watching someone write code teaches you very little about writing
          code. You have to write code by yourself.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For none of the exercises you need information that was not discussed
          in the book up to that point. While there definitely may be easier
          ways to do some of the exercises if you would use Python constructs
          that I did not discuss yet at the time you get to the exercises, you
          do not need them. The purpose of the exercises is to practice with the
          discussed material. They are not meant to let you investigate future
          material. Even if you are aware of different ways to solve an
          exercise, try to do it with only the material discussed. Once you have
          done that, if you want to return to an exercise later and solve it in
          a different way, that is, of course, fine.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Once you have solved an exercise by yourself and have tested it
          extensively, then and only then you should compare it to the answer
          that I provided. You may find that it is different from yours. That
          does not mean that your answer is wrong! There are usually very many
          ways to solve a programming problem. Some might be "better" in some
          way than others. But there are many answers that are equally correct.
          Moreover, in this book it is important that you learn to solve a
          problem by coding, not that you learn to code the most efficient
          solution to a problem. Just being able to solve the problem suffices,
          making solutions more efficient is of much lesser importance. For
          instance, "being efficient" is less important than "being easy to
          understand" and "being easy to maintain".</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For starters, here are two numbered exercises for the first chapter.
